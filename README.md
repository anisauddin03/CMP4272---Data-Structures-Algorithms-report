# CMP4272---Data-Structures-Algorithms-report
In my module, Data Structures and Algorithms, I have created an article assessing different algorithms and developed a program that enables to record run-time and efficiency of the algorithms which is concluded in the article.

I have attached the pdf article and also the file which includes the code to all of implmentation and assessments of the following programmes: Linear Search, Binary Search, Selection Sort, Quick Sort.

All information were sourced from lecture slides and the following:

Moreover, code blocks were modified from GeeksfoGeeks and OverStack Flow.

Thank you for reading. I hope this helps others to understand Data Structures and Algorithms and support their knowledge in this topic.
